# Cloud Portable Storage

S3-compatible APIs have become the de-facto standard for digital storage.

This is a Request for Comments (RFC) to define a strict, minimal subset of the S3 API. The aim is to enable interoperability across cloud providers and open source tools. 

Write code once. Run it on AWS, Cloudflare, MinIO, or your own server. Any bucket will do.



Motivation:

"In a world where digital infrastructure is often foreign-owned and opaque, wanting more control is natural. 
But sovereignty, if defined as owning every layer of a technological stack, can quickly become counterproductive. It leads to balkanized systems, limited interoperability and a retrenchment from global cooperation. 
The incentives for creative development disappear. Competition and innovation subside."

The goal here is to create a path to agency and sovergnity through portability. For those interested in greater agency, standards are a path to portiability between foreign vendors and domestic providers. 
While foreign ownership can carry risks, so to can vendor lock in with domestic providers. Moreover, building a bespoke domestic digital infrastructure is a path to  

 We need open specifications that commodify mature technologies—starting with object storage and government platform services. Success means making provider switching simple and creating a liquid market where domestic providers compete on service, not lock-in.
This requires governments to become market shapers: using procurement power to demand interoperability, recognizing de facto standards, and coordinating across borders. The goal isn't destroying hyperscalers—it's taming them through specifications that make sovereignty achievable for all countries, not just the wealthy.
The alternative—permanent lock-in or expensive isolation—is far worse. We have the precedent, the leverage, and the path. What's needed is capacity and will.

Firstly, real-world digital ecosystems don’t emerge in clean stacks. They evolve through messy, iterative and user-driven processes. This can mean thousands of developers and services, constantly refining their implementation and approaches. Platforms don’t beget services. Services beget platforms. It reflects a core truth of digital development: useful infrastructure is almost always the byproduct of real-world service delivery.
